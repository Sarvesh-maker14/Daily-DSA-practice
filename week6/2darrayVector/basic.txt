                1.rows increase
                2.variable columns
                3.problem with 2D arrays is that we have to pass size of row and column when passing the 2D array to a function
                4.this problem is resolved in 2D vector 
                vector< vector<int> > &v // pass by reference

2D vectors are vector of vectors

vector< vector<int> > v(m) --> it can store "m" vectors
